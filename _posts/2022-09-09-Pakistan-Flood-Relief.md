In August 2022 when Pakistan was hit with severe flloding, Ericsson had askde employees if they were willing to help Pakistan by donating. Asides from the partnernship with Red Cross, some people at Ericsson decided to gather donations locally and send it to Pakistan. Thus, a campaign was started to gather donations within Ottawa for Pakistan. 

In this campaign, flyers were put up and distrubuted around neighbourhoods encouraging locals to donate shoes, boots, clothes, blankets and other items that they did not need around the house anymore. Once the campaign was started, I would join my coworkers and their family friends in packing the donations into boxes and placing them in **garages**. Although I was not there to count the total weight, we gathered, packed and shipped about 5 **garages** worth of donations to Pakistan. 

Overall, the campaign was a success, and I demonstrated and aptidude for organizational skills, being a team-player and displayed potential to be a heavy lifter (although I was sore for the nexr couple of days).
