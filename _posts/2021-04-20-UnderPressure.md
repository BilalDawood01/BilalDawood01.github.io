### Overview

Our project aimed to develop an innovative audio-based posture corrector designed to help users maintain proper seating posture, thereby reducing the risk of chronic back pain. This project was a collaborative effort within my Learning Community, where we combined our skills and expertise to bring this concept to life.

### My Contributions

- **Team Coordination**: Successfully coordinated with team members across different time zones, ensuring efficient communication and task allocation.
- **Circuit Design**: Contributed to designing the circuit using resistive sensors and a voltage divider, which enabled posture detection.
- **Microcontroller Integration**: Implemented the use of an Arduino Nano for programming the device, leveraging a teammate's prior experience for optimal results.
- **Prototype Development**: Assisted in creating a physical prototype and presenting it during our consumer pitch, receiving positive feedback.

### Teamwork and Collaboration

Working on this project provided valuable experience in teamwork and collaboration:
- **Strength Utilization**: Identified and leveraged each team member's strengths, dividing tasks effectively.
- **Accountability**: Used burndown charts and sprint planning sessions to ensure group and individual accountability.
- **Meeting Coordination**: Managed the challenge of scheduling meetings across different time zones, ensuring inclusivity and comprehensive communication through meeting minutes.

### Project Details

#### Design Concept

- **User-Friendly Mat**: Designed a comfortable mat that seamlessly fits onto a chair, with the main circuitry housed in a secure casing underneath.
- **Customizable Audio Cues**: The device uses audio messages to prompt users to correct their posture, with customizable audio options to suit user preferences.

#### Technical Specifications

- **Power Supply**: Utilizes a 9V battery connected to a 5V regulator.
- **Sensors and Circuitry**: Features pressure-sensitive resistors embedded within the mat to detect bad posture, connected through a voltage divider.
- **Microcontroller**: Programmed using an Arduino Nano, chosen for its compatibility and ease of use.

### Product Casing

- **3D Printed Casing**: Developed a 3D printed cuboid casing to house the main circuitry, which is securely attached to the chair.
- **Embedded Sensors**: Ensured that the resistive sensors are safely embedded within a yoga mat-like material for user comfort.

#### Is This Product Really Necessary?

Back pain is the number one reason for workers missing work in the United States and among the main reasons for missing work for the rest of the world. This product is aimed at those that spend a majority of their time on a chair in front of a computer. This includes office workers and students. An overwhelming majority of office workers will develop chronic back pain sometime in their life and it is always a growing issue all across the world as people are sitting in front of a computer screen for longer periods of time. During these times, it is easy to get distracted and forget about your posture which leads to several long term issues.

> "When you use good posture, your muscles and other structures function properly, helping you to avoid abnormal wear and tear. Improper posture places stress on your joints and can cause them to wear away. This is the most common cause of osteoarthritis, a form of 'wear and tear' arthritis. Keeping your body aligned in the proper posture can reduce muscle fatigue and strain and help keep your joints healthy and lubricated."
> â€“ Barrington Orthopedic Specialists

### Technical Specifications and Features

As shown in the circuit design diagram above, the circuit is powered by a 9V battery connected to a 5V regulator.

- **Pressure Sensors**: Read inputs or changes in the user's seating position and utilize a voltage divider in order for the device to decide if an audio cue to remind the user to fix their posture is needed.
- **Microcontroller**: The programming is done with the help of an Arduino Nano controller.
- **Audio Cues**: Customizable to cater to the user's preferences.
- **Mat Material**: Ideally made out of a yoga mat-like material with the thin pressure sensors embedded within the mat.

### Achievements

- **Prototype Presentation**: Successfully presented a working prototype, receiving enthusiastic reactions during our consumer pitch.
- **Skill Development**: Gained hands-on experience in circuit design, microcontroller programming, and team collaboration.

### Conclusion

This project not only highlights my technical skills and ability to work effectively within a team but also demonstrates my commitment to creating practical solutions that address real-world problems. I look forward to applying these experiences and skills in future projects and professional endeavors.
