## ENEL 353 Lab Project: Digital Logic Design

## Project Overview:
This lab project focused on the practical application of digital logic design concepts, including the implementation of d-latches, d-flip-flops, and a synchronous detector circuit. The goal was to understand the operation and design of digital components and verify their functionality through simulation.

## What I Did:
- **Digital Component Implementation**: Designed and implemented d-latches and d-flip-flops using basic circuit elements. Verified their operation by analyzing the waveform responses to various input signals.
- **Circuit Design**: Developed a synchronous detector circuit to detect a specific binary sequence (0-1-0-0-1). Created state transition diagrams and K-maps to define the behavior of the circuit and optimized the logical expressions.
- **State Transition and Optimization**: Translated logical equations into functional logic gates and implemented them in Quartus software. Optimized the circuit design to ensure accurate detection and minimal resource usage.

## Achievements:
- **Accurate Functionality**: Demonstrated correct operation of digital components with precise waveform analysis, ensuring that the d-latches and d-flip-flops responded accurately to clock signals and data inputs.
- **Reliable Detection**: The synchronous detector circuit accurately identified the target binary sequence, validating the design and implementation.

## Skills Gained / Tools Used:
- **Technical Skills**: Digital logic design, FSM design, simulation, verification.
- **Tools**: Quartus software, Karnaugh Maps (K-maps).
