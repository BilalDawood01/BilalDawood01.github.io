## Project Overview:
This project aimed to apply theoretical knowledge of wireless communication by designing a Yagi-Uda antenna using low-cost materials. The project involved designing, building, and testing the antenna to evaluate its performance in various conditions.

## What I Did:
- **Antenna Design**: Created a Yagi-Uda antenna using copper wires, a split coaxial cable, and basic materials. Calculated the optimal lengths for the driver, reflector, and director elements to maximize signal reception.
- **Experimentation**: Conducted experiments to measure the antenna's performance under different conditions, such as the presence of various materials (cardboard, tinfoil, RF absorber) and orientations. Analyzed the impact of these conditions on signal strength and quality.
- **Simulation and Analysis**: Used RTL-SDR USB radio devices and software to validate the antenna's design and functionality. Measured power transfer and signal strength to ensure optimal performance.

## Achievements:
- **Effective Design**: Achieved a power transfer of -20dB, indicating efficient signal reception with minimal reflection.
- **Robust Testing**: Demonstrated the antenna's robustness through comprehensive testing with various materials and orientations. The antenna maintained consistent performance across different scenarios.

## Skills Gained / Tools Used:
- **Technical Skills**: Antenna design, signal processing, hands-on experimentation.
- **Tools**: RTL-SDR USB radio device, simulation software, copper wires, wooden rod, adhesive tacks.
