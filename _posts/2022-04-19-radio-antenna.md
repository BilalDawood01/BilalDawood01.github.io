## Project Overview:
This project focused on analyzing and implementing an amplitude modulation (AM) receiver. The goal was to design a functional AM receiver system and evaluate its performance through various stages of design, testing, and analysis.

## What I Did:
- **Designed and Implemented**: Developed an AM receiver system incorporating active filters and base-band amplifier circuits, ensuring the circuit was capable of receiving and demodulating AM broadcast signals.
- **Circuit Analysis**: Conducted thorough DC and AC analysis to optimize circuit performance. This included calculating the resonance frequency, tuning the circuit components, and ensuring minimal signal distortion.
- **Signal Analysis**: Probed signals at different points in the circuit to ensure accurate reception and demodulation. Verified the functionality of each stage using an oscilloscope and simulation software.

## Achievements:
- **Successful Implementation**: Achieved clear and stable audio signal output with a voltage gain of -32.03 and a small signal gain of -49.95.
- **Precise Calibration**: Resonance frequency accurately set at 503.29 kHz, ensuring the circuit operated at the desired frequency with minimal interference.

## Skills Gained / Tools Used:**
- **Technical Skills**: Circuit design, signal processing, simulation, and testing.
- **Tools**: Oscilloscope, Multisim, Vector Network Analyzer.
