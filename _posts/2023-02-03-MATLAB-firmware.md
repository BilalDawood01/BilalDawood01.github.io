Having worked extensively on hardware development and verification during the begining of my internship, I decided to ask my manager if I could move to a more software role to gain more experience and observe how other departments operate. My manager agreed, and I was allowed to move to Backend MATLAB development for Ericsson's Web Application (Ericsson Indoor Planner).

Although I had considered myself adept at MATLAB before taking part in this role, I was surprised by the sheer volume of code and complex MATLAB computation the web application was conducting behind the scenes. Even after completing the almost month-long training module, I found myself asking questions to superior and attempting to gain guidance and ensure I had the correct implementation of internal MATLAB functions. 

Asides from code development and documentation review, another responsibilty I had in this role was to do a peer review of my collegues' code as well.
